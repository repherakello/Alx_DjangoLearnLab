Here's how you can implement the CRUD features in your Django blog project based on the task:

Step 1: Implement CRUD Operations
Create the Views in blog/views.py:
Step 2: Create and Configure Forms
You can rely on Django's ModelForm by defining fields directly in the CreateView and UpdateView, as shown above. This eliminates the need for an explicit form unless custom validation is required.
Step 3: Set Up Templates
Templates Required:
Post List Template (post_list.html):
Post Detail Template (post_detail.html):
Post Form Template (post_form.html):
Post Delete Confirmation (post_confirm_delete.html):
Step 4: Define URL Patterns
In blog/urls.py:
Step 5: Implement Permissions
Permissions are already handled using:

LoginRequiredMixin to ensure only authenticated users can create, update, or delete posts.
UserPassesTestMixin to ensure only the author can edit or delete their posts.
Step 6: Test Blog Post Features
Testing Views: Use Postman, Djangoâ€™s admin, or browser to test:

Creating a post.
Viewing the list of posts.
Viewing an individual post.
Editing and deleting a post.
Automated Tests (Optional): Add tests in blog/tests.py to ensure CRUD functionality works as expected.
